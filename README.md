# HapticsProject
To implement a 3d surface reconstruction algorithm in python that estimates the surface roughness and thereby establishes the foundation for haptic rendering from a 2d image based
on the paper 'Image-based haptic roughness estimation and rendering for haptic palpation from in vivo skin image'
Using numpy,scipy and open3d libraries in python
